FCParser is designed to work on UNIX systems with python installed. Almost every linux distribution come with python pre-installed. For library compatibility, python 2.7 is the chosen version.

The program requires some python modules to work properly. Before using this tool, install the following packages:

1) Ipy: Python module for handling IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and networks

$ pip install IPy

2) PyYAML: YAML analyzer for python:

$ pip install PyYAML

Alternatively, running the following command installs both, the corresponding FCParser modules and the previous mentioned dependencies.

$ python <CURRENT_DIR>/setup.py install

Note: In order to work with netflow data in nfcapd format, the netflow processing tool Nfdump is also required.
